// LogLevel This setting determines the log level for nodes across the cluster to use when recording entries in the log. All entries below the specified log level are discarded, where \"error\" is the highest log level and \"debug\" is the lowest. This setting is only checked by nodes on startup. Changing this setting will not affect the behaviour of nodes that are already operational.
