type NfsAclSquashConfig struct {

	Gid int64 `json:"gid,omitempty"`
	// SquashConfig defines the root squashing behaviour.  When a client creates a file, it sends the user UID from the client. If the client is running as root, this sends uid=0. Root squashing allows the NFS administrator to prevent the client from writing as \"root\" to the NFS share, instead mapping the client to a new UID/GID (usually nfsnobody, -2). \"none\" performs no UID/GID alterations, using the values sent by the client. \"root\" mapps UID & GID 0 to the values specified. \"rootuid\" maps UID 0 and a GID of any value to the value specified. \"all\" maps changes all UID and GID values to those specified.
