                            SquashConfig defines the root squashing behaviour. 
                            
                            When a client creates a file, it sends the user UID
                            from the client. If the client is running as root,
                            this sends uid=0. Root squashing allows the NFS
                            administrator to prevent the client from writing as
                            "root" to the NFS share, instead mapping the client
                            to a new UID/GID (usually nfsnobody, -2).

                            "none" performs no UID/GID alterations, using the
                            values sent by the client.

                            "root" mapps UID & GID 0 to the values specified.

                            "rootuid" maps UID 0 and a GID of any value to the
                            value specified.

                            "all" maps changes all UID and GID values to those
                            specified.

                Requests that the target node gathers detailed information
                about the state of the cluster, using it to then build and
                return a bundle which can be used for troubleshooting.

                The request will only be served when the authenticated user
                is an administrator.

                The node will attempt to gather information about its local
                state, cluster-wide state and local state of other nodes
                in the cluster. If the cluster is unhealthy this may cause
                a slower response.
