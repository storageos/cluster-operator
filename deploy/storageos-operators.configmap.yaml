                      means that failover of a StatefulSet pod is a manual operation.  By
                      enabling Pod Fencing and setting the `storageos.com/fenced=true` label
                      on a Pod, StorageOS will enable automated Pod failover (by killing
                      the application Pod on the failed node) if the following conditions
                      exist:  - Pod fencing has not been explicitly disabled. - StorageOS
                      has determined that the node the Pod is running on is   offline.  StorageOS
                      uses Gossip and TCP checks and will retry for 30   seconds.  At this
                      point all volumes on the failed node are marked   offline (irrespective
                      of whether fencing is enabled) and volume   failover starts. - The
                      Pod has the label `storageos.com/fenced=true` set. - The Pod has at
                      least one StorageOS volume attached. - Each StorageOS volume has at
                      least 1 healthy replica.  When Pod Fencing is disabled, StorageOS
                      will not perform any interaction with Kubernetes when it detects that
                      a node has gone offline. Additionally, the Kubernetes permissions
                      required for Fencing will not be added to the StorageOS role.'

                      are five possible phase values:   - Pending: The NFS Server has been
                      accepted by the Kubernetes system,     but one or more of the components
                      has not been created. This includes     time before being scheduled
                      as well as time spent downloading images     over the network, which
                      could take a while.   - Running: The NFS Server has been bound to
                      a node, and all of the     dependencies have been created.   - Succeeded:
                      All NFS Server dependencies have terminated in success,     and will
                      not be restarted.   - Failed: All NFS Server dependencies in the pod
                      have terminated, and     at least one container has terminated in
                      failure. The container     either exited with non-zero status or was
                      terminated by the system.   - Unknown: For some reason the state of
                      the NFS Server could not be     obtained, typically due to an error
                      in communicating with the host of     the pod.'

        displayName: StorageOS
        description: |
          StorageOS is a cloud native, software-defined storage platform that
          transforms commodity server or cloud based disk capacity into
          enterprise-class persistent storage for containers. StorageOS is ideal for
          deploying databases, message busses, and other mission-critical stateful
          solutions, where rapid recovery and fault tolerance are essential.

          The StorageOS Operator installs and manages StorageOS within a cluster.
          Cluster nodes may contribute local or attached disk-based storage into a
          distributed pool, which is then available to all cluster members via a
          global namespace.

          Volumes are available across the cluster so if a container gets moved to
          another node it has immediate access to re-attach its data. Data can be
          protected with synchronous replication. Compression, caching, and QoS are
          enabled by default, and all volumes are thinly-provisioned.

          No other hardware or software is required.

          StorageOS is free to use up to 50GB of presented storage, increasing to
          500GB after registration.  For additional capacity and support plans contact
          sales@storageos.com.

          ## Supported Features

          * **Rapid volume failover** - If a container gets re-scheduled to another
          node, any StorageOS volumes can be re-attached immediately, irrespective of
          where the data is located within the cluster.

          * **Data protection** - Data is replicated synchronously, up to 6 copies.

          * **Block checksums** - Each block is protected by a checksum which
          automatically detects any corruption of data in the underlying storage
          media.

          * **Thin provisioning** - Only consume the space you need in a storage pool.

          * **Data reduction** - Transparent inline data compression to reduce the
          amount of storage used in a backing store as well as reducing the network
          bandwidth requirements for replication.

          * **In-memory caching** - Speed up access to data even when accessed
          remotely.

          * **Quality of service** - Prioritize data traffic and address the “noisy
          neighbors” problem.

          * **Flexible configuration** - Use labels to automate data placement and
          enforce data policy such as replication. Ideal for compliance and infosec
          teams to enforce policies and rules while still enabling self-service
          storage by developers and DevOps teams.

          * **Access control** - Support multiple namespace – individual users are
          permissioned to specific storage namespaces.

          * **Observability & instrumentation** - Log streams for observability and
          Prometheus support for instrumentation.

          * **Deployment flexibility** - Scale up or scale out storage based on
          application requirements.  Works with any infrastructure – on-premises, VM,
          bare metal or cloud.

          * **Small footprint** - Lightweight container requires minimum 1 core with
          2GB of RAM.  Runs in user-space on any 64-bit Linux with no custom kernel
          modules.

          ## Prerequisites

          * Ensure port 5705 is open on the worker nodes.

          ## Required Parameters

          * `secretRefName` - the name of a secret that contains two keys for the
          `apiUsername` and `apiPassword` to be used as api credentials
          ([documentation](https://docs.storageos.com/docs/reference/cluster-operator/examples))
          * `secretRefNamespace` - the namespace where the api credentials secret is
          stored

          ## About StorageOS

          StorageOS gives users total control of their own storage environment –
          whether in the cloud or on-premises. Our customers take advantage of storage
          on any platform while maintaining full control of business requirements
          around availability, data mobility, performance, security, data residency
          compliance and business continuity.
